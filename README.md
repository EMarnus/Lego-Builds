## User Experience (UX)

### Strategy

#### Project Goals

* The website contains simple colors for a modern and clean design.

* Responsive design to make the website accessible on different screen sizes.

* Structure is easy to understand and navigates effortlessly.

* Site users are able to register an account in order to interact with the content.

* Site users are able to post events and indicate if they would like to attand.


#### User Goals
GitHub projects was used as my project management tool to track user stories. Using a Kanban board helped to focus on specific tasks and track the project progress. I used lables on the stories to priority of the feature.
